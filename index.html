            <p>The incredible growth in new technologies like machine learning has helped web developers build new AI applications in
            ways easier than ever. In the present day, most AI enthusiasts and developers in the field leverage Python frameworks
            for AI & machine learning development. But looking around, one may also find that JavaScript-based frameworks are also
            being implemented in AI.
            While the Python programming language feeds most machine learning frameworks, JavaScript has not lagged behind. This is
            the reason why JavaScript developers are using a number of frameworks for training and implementing machine learning
            models in the browser.
            In this blog, we will discuss various top machine learning JavaScript frameworks that you must consider for you’re
            seeking business growth through AI & machine learning.</p>

            <h2>Understanding Execution Context and Execution Stack in Javascript</h2>
            <p><a href="https://blog.bitsrc.io/understanding-execution-context-and-execution-stack-in-javascript-1c9ea8642dd0">Medium article</a></p>

            <p>What is an Execution Context?
            Simply put, an execution context is an abstract concept of an environment where the Javascript code is evaluated and
            executed. Whenever any code is run in JavaScript, it’s run inside an execution context.
            Types of Execution Context
            There are three types of execution context in JavaScript.
            Global Execution Context — This is the default or base execution context. The code that is not inside any function is in
            the global execution context. It performs two things: it creates a global object which is a window object (in the case
            of browsers) and sets the value of this to equal to the global object. There can only be one global execution context in
            a program.
            Functional Execution Context — Every time a function is invoked, a brand new execution context is created for that
            function. Each function has its own execution context, but it’s created when the function is invoked or called. There
            can be any number of function execution contexts. Whenever a new execution context is created, it goes through a series
            of steps in a defined order which I will discuss later in this article.
            Eval Function Execution Context — Code executed inside an eval function also gets its own execution context, but as eval
            isn’t usually used by JavaScript developers, so I will not discuss it here.
            Execution Stack
            Execution stack, also known as “calling stack” in other programming languages, is a stack with a LIFO (Last in, First
            out) structure, which is used to store all the execution context created during the code execution.
            When the JavaScript engine first encounters your script, it creates a global execution context and pushes it to the
            current execution stack. Whenever the engine finds a function invocation, it creates a new execution context for that
            function and pushes it to the top of the stack.
            The engine executes the function whose execution context is at the top of the stack. When this function completes, its
            execution stack is popped off from the stack, and the control reaches to the context below it in the current stack.</p>

            <p>There is more to hackers than the criminal behavior you hear about on the news. In fact, ethical hackers protect our
            data every day. Hackers wear many hats, making them a colorful and often misunderstood group. Take a look at the
            different types of hackers.
                White Hat Hackers:
            
                Mission: To protect organizations
                
                Personality trait: Ethical
                
                White hat hackers are hired to find security holes in an existing cyber system, so they can be patched.
            
                Blue Hat Hackers:
            
                Mission: To perfect unreleased software
                
                Personality trait: Precise
                
                Blue hat hackers are hired to test software for bugs before its release. The name is believed to have come from
                Microsoft’s blue employee badges.
            
                Gray Hat Hackers:
            
                Mission: To challenge themselves
                
                Personality trait: Ambitious
                
                Gray hat hackers search for and exploit security vulnerabilities without authorization.
            
                Black Hat Hackers:
            
                Mission: To profit from data breaches
                
                Personality trait: Malicious
                
                Black hat hackers conduct unauthorized cyberattacks to steal personal information to sell for profit.
                
                Callout: Committing a computer crime could lead to fines and multiple years in federal prison, depending on the offense.</p>
